                    <p><strong>Robert J. Paruch</strong> received his Ph.D. in computational physics at the
                        Jagiellonian
                        University in Krakow, Poland. His long-standing research interests are in computer modeling of
                        physical phenomena, associated analytical tools software development and data analysis aimed at
                        improving the efficiency and productivity of experimental setups. His work experience includes
                        a
                        five-year postdoctoral appointment at the Pennsylvania State University, the Department of
                        Chemistry, where his research projects focused on modeling of sputtering of materials by
                        energetic
                        particles and building analytical models. The results of his research helped in the development
                        of
                        new approaches to interpreting computer simulations, as well as optimization of the
                        secondary-ion
                        mass spectrometry analytical technique.</p>

                    <p>Coauthored over 25 scientific publications as a result of independent and collaborative work
                        within
                        the research group, peer-reviewed research publications, and presented the results of research
                        at
                        numerous international conferences and workshops.</p>

                    <p>In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, sightseeing and photographing.</p>

                    <p>Currently attending the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Oregon in order to round out the
                        skills
                        and gain the additional experience required to peruse the career opportunities in the
                        industrial
                        workspace.</p>
